V.1 What It Is
	• Password spraying tries one or a few passwords (like “Summer2023!”) across many user accounts. Avoids lockouts for each account because you do minimal attempts per account.
V.2 Why It Matters
	• Highly effective if the domain has users with weak or common password patterns.
V.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Get a user list (from AD enumeration or email lists).
	2. Choose common password(s) that meet domain policy complexity (e.g., “Spring2023!”).
	3. Use a tool like CrackMapExec, Metasploit, or Invoke-Spray.

bash
CopyEdit
crackmapexec smb <target_ip_or_range> -u users.txt -p "Summer2023!"
	4. If you get valid credentials, pivot further.
	5. Defend
		○ Monitor for multiple logins from single IP.
		○ Enforce strong password policy.
		○ Consider multi-factor authentication for domain logins if feasible.
