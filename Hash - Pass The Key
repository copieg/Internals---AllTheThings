F.1 What It Is
	• A concept similar to Pass-the-Hash but uses Kerberos keys (RC4, AES) directly.
	• Attackers pass the Kerberos key to get TGS or other tickets.
F.2 Why It Matters
	• If you have the AES or RC4 keys of a user, you can generate Kerberos tickets (like forging TGT with Rubeus).
	• Bypasses needing the user’s password or NTLM hash.
F.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Obtain the AES / RC4 Key
		○ Possibly from DCSync (mimikatz’s lsadump::dcsync), or from a TGT/TGS extraction.
	2. Rubeus usage

powershell
CopyEdit
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<base64ticket>
		○ Or generate a new TGT specifying the key.
	3. Use the Ticket
		○ Once injected, you can authenticate as that user to domain resources.
	4. Defend
		○ Similar to OverPass/Pass-the-Hash defenses: strong account segmentation, monitoring unusual ticket requests, limiting privileged account usage.
