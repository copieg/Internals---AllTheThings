J.1 What It Is
	• File shares (SMB, CIFS) in a Windows environment can hold scripts, config files, backups, etc.
	• Attackers look for misconfigurations allowing read/write or credentials stored in files.
J.2 Why It Matters
	• Shared directories might contain plaintext credentials, scripts with service passwords, or other sensitive data.
	• Write-access could let an attacker upload a malicious file that’s executed by a user or service.
J.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Scan for open shares
		○ Tools: smbmap, enum4linux, or Metasploit’s auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares.
	2. Check Permissions
		○ If you have write on a share used by a privileged user or service, you can drop a malicious script or .exe that gets executed.
	3. Read for Credentials
		○ Search for .config, .ini, .xml, .ps1, .bat for potential secrets.
		○ findstr /si "password" *.xml in Windows shares.
	4. Defend
		○ Principle of Least Privilege: restrict share permissions.
		○ Monitor file changes on critical shares.
		○ Don’t store credentials in plaintext.
