T.1 What It Is
	• Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) stores each machine’s local admin password in AD attributes, automatically rotates them.
T.2 Why It Matters
	• If an attacker can read the ms-MCS-AdmPwd attribute for a computer, they get its local admin password.
T.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Check if LAPS is deployed. Look for attributes:

powershell
CopyEdit
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties ms-MCS-AdmPwd
	2. If your user can read ms-MCS-AdmPwd, you get local admin on that system.
	3. Defend
		○ Configure LAPS GPO to only allow specific security groups to read the password.
		○ Audit who has read privileges.
