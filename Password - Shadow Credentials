U.1 What It Is
	• Attackers create a shadow credential for an AD account by adding a key in the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute (used for certificate or key-based logons).
U.2 Why It Matters
	• Let’s you authenticate as that user without their knowledge, effectively a hidden method of access.
U.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Identify a target user or computer object.
	2. Add a custom key credential link if you have write access to that object’s attribute (like GenericAll or WriteProperty).
	3. Authenticate with that key, forging claims as that user.
	4. Defend
		○ Monitor msDS-KeyCredentialLink changes.
		○ Restrict permissions on user objects.
