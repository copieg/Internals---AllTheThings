C.1 What It Is
	• Capturing password hashes (NTLM, LM, Net-NTLMv2, etc.) and cracking them offline with tools like Hashcat or John.
C.2 Why It Matters
	• Once an attacker has hashed credentials, they can attempt to crack them for clear-text passwords.
	• Weak or reused passwords are often quickly cracked, leading to broader compromise.
C.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Capture Hashes
		○ Techniques: LLMNR/Responder, SMB capture, NTDS.dit dump, Mimikatz, registry extraction.
		○ Save them to a file (e.g., hashes.txt).
	2. Choose Cracking Tool
		○ hashcat -m <mode> hashes.txt wordlist.txt
		○ john --format=<format> --wordlist=wordlist.txt hashes.txt
	3. Monitor Progress
		○ Use rules, masks, or incremental modes for deeper coverage if the password is complex.
	4. Use the Cracked Password
		○ Try it on other services or devices. Many users recycle credentials.
	5. Defend
		○ Enforce strong password policies.
		○ Disable LM hashes.
		○ Segment networks to reduce hash capturing opportunities.
