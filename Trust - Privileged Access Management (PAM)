W.1 What It Is
	• PAM solutions (e.g., Microsoft’s MIM PAM, or third-party) limit the time a user or group has privileged access, storing credentials in a separate bastion environment.
W.2 Why It Matters
	• If misconfigured, attackers can still escalate or maintain privileges. Or they may find ways to bypass the bastion process.
W.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Identify if a PAM solution is in use (MIM, etc.).
	2. Look for ways to add your account to privileged groups bypassing the approval process.
	3. Steal credentials from the bastion server or intercept the authentication tokens.
	4. Defend
		○ Properly isolate the PAM environment.
		○ Monitor group membership changes.
		○ Regularly review logs from the bastion infrastructure.
