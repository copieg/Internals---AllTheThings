O.1 What It Is
	• Some users or admins store plaintext or partial credentials in the “comment” or “description” field of their AD user object.
O.2 Why It Matters
	• Easy place for attackers to find credentials with simple AD enumeration.
O.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Enumerate user attributes:

powershell
CopyEdit
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties description | ? { $_.description -like "*pass*" }
	2. Look for password references in description.
	3. Defend
		○ Educate admins/users not to store passwords in user comments.
		○ Periodically scan for sensitive keywords.
