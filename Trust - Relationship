X.1 What It Is
	• Inter-forest or external trusts between AD forests or domains.
	• Let’s users in one domain authenticate to resources in another.
X.2 Why It Matters
	• Attackers can pivot from a less secure or child domain to a parent or trusted forest.
	• They might exploit misconfigurations in trust direction or create forging tickets.
X.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Enumerate domain trusts:

powershell
CopyEdit
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
	2. Check if trust is two-way or external.
	3. Use tools like Mimikatz or Impacket to forge cross-domain TGT (e.g., “Silver Ticket” for the trusting domain’s resource).
	4. Defend
		○ Use selective authentication for external trusts.
		○ Monitor cross-domain Kerberos ticket usage.
		○ Keep consistent policies across trusted forests.kerb
