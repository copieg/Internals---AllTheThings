S.1 What It Is
	• gMSA: A special type of AD account that automatically rotates its password, designed for services and tasks.
S.2 Why It Matters
	• Properly used gMSA is safer than a normal service account. But if an attacker can read the password (via the gMSA’s key distribution group), they compromise that service.
S.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Identify the gMSA’s msDS-GroupMSAMembership.
	2. If you’re in that group or can manipulate membership, you can retrieve the password:

powershell
CopyEdit
Get-ADServiceAccount -Identity <gMSAName> -Properties *
# Or use scripts like Mimikatz or PowerView

	3. Defend
		○ Restrict who can read gMSA passwords.
		○ Don’t add broad groups to msDS-GroupMSAMembership.
