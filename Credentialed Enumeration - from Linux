Now that we have acquired a foothold in the domain, it is time to dig deeper using our low privilege domain user credentials. Since we have a general idea about the domain's userbase and machines, it's time to enumerate the domain in depth. 
We are interested in information about domain user and computer attributes, group membership, Group Policy Objects, permissions, ACLs, trusts, and more. We have various options available, 
but the most important thing to remember is that most of these tools will not work without valid domain user credentials at any permission level. So at a minimum, 
we will have to have acquired a user's cleartext password, NTLM password hash, or SYSTEM access on a domain-joined host.


CrackMapExec
CrackMapExec (CME, now NetExec) is a powerful toolset to help with assessing AD environments. 
It utilizes packages from the Impacket and PowerSploit toolkits to perform its functions. 
For detailed explanations on using the tool and accompanying modules, see the wiki. Don't be afraid to use the -h flag to review the available options and syntax.

We can see that we can use the tool with MSSQL, SMB, SSH, and WinRM credentials. Let's look at our options for CME with the SMB protocol:

<SNIP>  

CME offers a help menu for each protocol (i.e., crackmapexec winrm -h, etc.). Be sure to review the entire help menu and all possible options. For now, the flags we are interested in are:

-u Username The user whose credentials we will use to authenticate
-p Password User's password
Target (IP or FQDN) Target host to enumerate (in our case, the Domain Controller)
--users Specifies to enumerate Domain Users
--groups Specifies to enumerate domain groups
--loggedon-users Attempts to enumerate what users are logged on to a target, if any


We'll start by using the SMB protocol to enumerate users and groups. 
We will target the Domain Controller (whose address we uncovered earlier) because it holds all data in the domain database that we are interested in. Make sure you preface all commands with sudo.



CME - Domain User Enumeration
We start by pointing CME at the Domain Controller and using the credentials for the forend user to retrieve a list of all domain users. 
Notice when it provides us the user information, it includes data points such as the badPwdCount attribute. This is helpful when performing actions like targeted password spraying. 
We could build a target user list filtering out any users with their badPwdCount attribute above 0 to be extra careful not to lock any accounts out.

The above snippet lists the groups within the domain and the number of users in each. The output also shows the built-in groups on the Domain Controller, such as Backup Operators. We can begin to note down groups of interest. 
Take note of key groups like Administrators, Domain Admins, Executives, any groups that may contain privileged IT admins, etc. These groups will likely contain users with elevated privileges worth targeting during our assessment.

CME - Logged On Users
We can also use CME to target other hosts. Let's check out what appears to be a file server to see what users are logged in currently.


MartinRouterKing@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.130 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users

<SNIP>


We see that many users are logged into this server which is very interesting. We can also see that our user forend is a local admin because (Pwn3d!) appears after the tool successfully authenticates to the target host. 


CME Share Searching
We can use the --shares flag to enumerate available shares on the remote host and the level of access our user account has to each share (READ or WRITE access). 
Let's run this against the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Domain Controller.

We see several shares available to us with READ access. The Department Shares, User Shares, and ZZZ_archive shares would be worth digging into further as they may contain sensitive data such as passwords or PII. 
Next, we can dig into the shares and spider each directory looking for files. The module spider_plus will dig through each readable share on the host and list all readable files. Let's give it a try.
