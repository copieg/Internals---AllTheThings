D.1 What It Is
	• OverPass-The-Hash is a variation of pass-the-hash using Kerberos tickets instead of purely NTLM.
	• You use an NTLM hash to request a Kerberos TGT from the domain, effectively skipping the need for the clear-text password.
D.2 Why It Matters
	• Bypasses standard pass-the-hash detection because it’s using Kerberos after forging the TGT.
	• Attackers can escalate or move laterally in AD without knowing the real password.
D.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Obtain NTLM Hash
		○ E.g., from Mimikatz or a SAM/NTDS dump.
	2. Use Mimikatz OverPass

powershell
CopyEdit
sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:corp.local /ntlm:<hash> /run:cmd.exe
		○ This requests a TGT with that hash, granting a Kerberos token.
	3. Access Resources
		○ You now have a Kerberos ticket as Administrator (if the hash is for an admin account).
	4. Defend
		○ Detect suspicious TGT requests for unusual accounts.
		○ Use LSA Protection and Credential Guard where possible.
		○ Regularly rotate admin credentials.
