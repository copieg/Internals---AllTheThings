H.1 What It Is
	• Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) typically on local subnets, capturing credentials or relaying them to another service.
	• Relay takes captured credentials (e.g., NTLM) and uses them to authenticate to a different target (SMB Relay, LDAP Relay).
H.2 Why It Matters
	• Attackers can trick a machine into authenticating to them (via LLMNR, mDNS, or NBNS) and then relay those credentials to a target system for remote code execution.
H.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Set up Responder or MITM6:

bash
CopyEdit
python Responder.py -I eth0 -rdw
	2. Wait for a victim broadcast name resolution request.
	3. Capture the Net-NTLMv2 hash from the handshake.
	4. Relay it to a target with ntlmrelayx:

bash
CopyEdit
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support
		○ Potentially gain a shell if the target is not enforcing SMB signing.
	5. Defend
		○ Disable LLMNR, NBNS.
		○ Enable SMB signing.
		○ Use LDAP signing and LDAPS.
		○ Restrict local admin privileges to reduce success of relayed creds.
