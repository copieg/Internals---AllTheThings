K.1 What It Is
	• The Bronze Bit attack (also called service ticket “S4U2self” forging) manipulates flags in a Kerberos ticket to escalate privileges.
K.2 Why It Matters
	• Attackers can modify certain bits in the ticket to appear as if it was derived from a higher privilege.
	• Can bypass certain constraints on Kerberos delegation or ticket usage.
K.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Obtain a service ticket or TGS.
	2. Manipulate the Kerberos flags or “forwardable” fields using custom scripts (like a modified Rubeus or specialized code).
	3. Redeem the altered ticket on the target service, tricking it into giving higher privileges.
	4. Defend
		○ Keep domain controllers patched for known Bronze Bit or S4U2self vulnerabilities.
		○ Monitor unusual ticket requests or suspicious TGS traffic.
