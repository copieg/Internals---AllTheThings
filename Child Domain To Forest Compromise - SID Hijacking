Y.1 What It Is
	• SID History can store old SIDs from previous domains. Attackers can inject a domain admin SID into a user’s SID history, effectively giving domain admin rights in the new domain.
Y.2 Why It Matters
	• This is often used when you have control of a child domain and want to escalate to the forest root domain.
Y.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Own the child domain (e.g., domain admin in child).
	2. Use Mimikatz or custom scripts to add the forest root domain’s admin SID to the user’s SID History.
	3. Authenticate in the root domain as if you’re an admin.
	4. Defend
		○ Restrict who can set SID History.
		○ Enable SID Filtering on domain trusts.
		○ Monitor domain trusts for suspicious changes.
