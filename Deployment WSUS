B.1 What It Is
	• Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) manages and distributes Windows updates to domain machines.
	• Typically runs on a server that client PCs trust for OS and application patches.
B.2 Why It Matters
	• If attackers control WSUS, they can push malicious updates or tamper with patches.
	• Clients will trust these updates as signed or “approved,” leading to mass compromise.
B.3 How to Exploit (Step-by-Step)
	1. Identify WSUS Server
		○ Check DNS for wsus, updates, or netstat on endpoints to see where they request updates.
	2. Privilege Escalation
		○ If you gain local admin or credentials on the WSUS server, you can modify the update packages or metadata.
		○ Tools or scripts can inject malicious .msu files or tamper with existing updates.
	3. Deploy Malicious Updates
		○ In the WSUS console, mark your trojanized package as “approved.”
		○ Domain machines download and install it at next scheduled update.
	4. Defend
		○ Use SSL/TLS for WSUS signing and secure channels.
		○ Restrict admin access to WSUS.
		○ Monitor changes to the WSUS console and update approvals.
